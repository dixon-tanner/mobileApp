        <h2>General Info</h2>
        <hr />
        
        <p>In New Hampshire, Dean Kamen noticed that a lot of the kids there were interested in being sports players or movie stars. He wanted to make a difference in the world and get kids into science and math. He came up with <strong>FIRST</strong> or <strong>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</strong>. This new program, which is now a world-wide one, was about learning how to build, wire, program, and compete with robots. Each year participants are given goals and items on a field that can be used to score points. There are three groups to the program, <strong>FRC, FTC, </strong>and <strong>FLL</strong>, or <strong>FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge, </strong> and <strong>FIRST Lego League.</strong> Each group is for different age levels. FLL is for younger kids and middle school students, while FTC and FRC is for high school students.</p>  
        
        <p> I participate in the <strong>FIRST</strong> robotics club in Twin Falls Idaho. I usually concentrate on the FTC part of the club. There are five teams in Twin Falls. One of them is a FRC team and the number is 4086. The other ones are FTC, they are 5024, 5025, 5026, and 4606. We all work together, share ideas and parts, and help each other with designs and look out for each other.</p>
        
        <h2>Year 1</h2>
        <hr />
       
        <p>I was on 5025 or Tesla Flyers. 5025 last year went to the Moscow Idaho and the Casper Wyoming Competitions. Since Moscow was our first competition we were still learning what to do. Our robot was great for a first time. We then went to Casper. We won there because we learned what we need to do to have fun and make our robot better. Since we won we got to go to the World Competition in St. Louis Missouri. We did pretty well considering we were rookies and we were still figuring things out.</p>
        
	<h2>Year 2</h2>
	<hr />
        
     <p>My team is 5024 and my team name is the Tesla Tazers, formerly Tesla A's. Last year  Now that we have had a little more experience we did better at Moscow. We came in 4th place and went to the semifinals and almost to the finals. One of our sister teams, 4606 Tesla Titans, were against us and we lost. They made it to worlds this year and we did to at the Ogden Utah Championship in March. We went undefeated and on April 24 went to worlds. We won four and lost four matches. We placed 29th in our division.</p>
